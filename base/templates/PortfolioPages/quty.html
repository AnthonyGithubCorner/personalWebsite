{% block retro %}Last summer (2019) I really started getting serious about gaining some professional experience. While I was thinking about my resume above all I really wanted to start exploring career pathways and to try and figure out what I wanted to do. To that end, I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to work as a tech consultant for a local company. The task they wanted someone to do but had no time for is the creation of a quoting tool for their sales representatives. Essentially they needed an easy to use software so that their sales team can give quote estimates on the amount the companies services would cost potential customers. Before it required them using an old database to tally it up. Over a month I used Django and a simple HTML/CSS front end to accomplish this task by connecting to the old database and displaying the information from there in a fast and easy to use way. I am really happy with how it turned out. This work really gave me some perspective on the software development industry. I learned that a lot of the job is not just programming but simply trying to understand what others want from you. This simple fact changed how I looked at programming as a career, while I have no problem working in groups to accomplish tasks, I can find myself frustrated at unclear requirements, impossible asks and long unfruitful discussions. While I have only nice things to say about working on this project, the slight frustrations I experienced there have made me worried about the stronger frustrations I might face if I were to continue down this field. While I have no intention to ever stop programming this experience has made me warier of the professional environment in possibly all fields that I will have to learn to accept. There is no ‘I’ in team!
