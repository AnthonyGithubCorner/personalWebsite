{% block retro %}During the grade 10 school year (2018-2019) I joined a student program designed to make student-led start-up companies. I was lucky enough to help lead one as the “VP of IT”. As the VP of IT, I was responsible mainly for creating the website for our start up. The start-up was a tea company that would package sustainably sourced tea and take 30% of the profit to charity. I am quite proud of being in this company especially when we were able to raise over 500$ for charity. While sadly the company liquidated back in 2019 and as such the website no longer exists, I still have the initial design documents I helped make and put onto a digital format. Looking at the design documents I’m still quite proud of my ability to replicate it, especially in WordPress. The reason I used WordPress is that a lot of people on the team wanted to help contribute to the content of the website. If I were to make it from scratch it would be very difficult to teach others to use. For this reason, I created a WordPress site and then used extensive CSS to force it to how I wanted it to look. This allowed others to use WordPress's simple interface to add the content of their choosing while the website’s quality is not harmed. This worked out pretty okay and without much frustration on my part. While the site wasn’t used as much as I would have hoped it was still a great learning experience on how to use WordPress and how to freely host a WordPress site.{% endblock %}
