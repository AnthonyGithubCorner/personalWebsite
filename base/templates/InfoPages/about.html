                <h3>Basics</h3>
                <p>My name is Anthony Lazar, I am currently in high school, I live near the Toronto area (that one city
                    that won basketball and where the guy who sings "hotline bling" came
                    from). If you want to get in touch just leave me a message <a
                            href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">here</a>. </p>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>I am "lucky" enough to get an IB education from an accredited high school and am currently working
                    towards completing that diploma and then (hopefully) heading off to a good university for engineer.</p>
                <div style="padding-left: 20px">
                    <h5>What Type Of Engineering?</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: smaller">I've narrowed it down to two polar opposite types, software engineering and mechanical
                        engineering</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Interests?</h3>
                <p>Weird Tech Projects (like this), video games especially anything nintendo, helping out the
                    environment, reading (currently making my way through
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_Me,_I'm_Lying">Trust Me I'm Lying</a>
                    ), rock music (though I am listening to retrowave music right now). I think
                    that's more than enough, I can go all day. </p>
                <h3>What Did You Do During Quarantine?</h3>
